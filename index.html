                <h3>Who is Chris Cummings?<img id="headshot" src="img/headshot350x450.png"></h3>
                <p>Hello! My name is Chris and I'm a junior software developer with a passion for coding. I've lived in the greater
                    seattle area for most of my life, but have also lived in Spokane, WA as well as Honolulu, Hawaii.  I spent some time working retail 
                    before going to get an AAS at Spokane Community College in the Water Resources Technology Field.  With that, 
                    I landed a job in Honolulu, Hawaii working for the U.S. Geological Survey!  After a change, I ended up working 
                    for Google Maps as a Visual Data Specialist and later an Assistant Pod Lead.  It's been quite the journey, 
                    and now I'm ready to show off my software development skills, wrapped in the life experience that makes up me!</p>
                    <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me playing tennis, playing a video game or designing fantasy worlds and settings!  If I'm not there, I'm enjoying a delicious beer at your local brewery.  In the future, I'd love to own an English Bulldog (though I'm not sure what I would name it)!</p>
